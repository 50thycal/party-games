# Implementation Handoff

<!-- Copied from 50thycal/build-os templates/PR_HANDOFF.template.md at Build OS v0.4.
     Re-copy from canonical when Build OS changes it; do not edit it into a local variant.
     This PR body is the authoritative handoff. Every section is required; sections with
     nothing to report say `None`. Keep it current if the PR changes. -->

## Goal

> After this change, the system should <quoted from the Build Card>.

## Architecture / Flow

## Major Areas Changed

<!-- The shape of the change, not a file dump. The diff already lists every file. -->

## Design Decisions

<Technical decisions made during implementation, with reasoning.>

- 

## Spec Deviations

<!-- Any departure from approved behavior or requirements, referencing OD-n / R-n / AC-n.
     Write `None` explicitly when there are none. If unsure whether something counts,
     it counts. -->

None

## Tests / Validation

<What was run, with actual results. What is covered and what is not.>

- `<command>` — <result>
- New tests: <what they cover>
- Not covered: <gaps>

## Known Risks / Limitations

<Concrete. Unhandled edges, behavior under load, assumptions that could prove wrong,
deploy risk.>

- 

## Recommended Review Focus

<Where an independent reviewer should scrutinize. Name specific places.>

## Framework

<!-- Omit for small PRs. Never record a check that did not happen. -->

Framework:
- Project adopted: v0.x
- Canonical checked: v0.x
- Compatibility: current
<!-- or: upgrade required / Migration performed: <what> -->

## Workstream

<!-- ID, phase before → after, and whether this PR completes it. `None` if not applicable. -->

WS-### — <title>. <PHASE> → <PHASE>. <Completes / does not complete> the workstream.

## Follow-up Work

<Intentional deferrals, each with the reason. Not a parking lot for unfinished in-scope
work.>

## Owner Summary

<!-- ~100 words max. Plain language, no file or function names. What changed, what behaves
     differently, meaningful deviations, unresolved owner decisions. Put any unresolved
