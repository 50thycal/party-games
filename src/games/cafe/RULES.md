   - $40 starting money
   - 3 upgrade cards in hand
   - Empty supply storage (no starting supplies)

2. **Shared reputation track** starts at 0 (neutral)

3. **Customer deck** is shuffled (52 total customer cards across 5 archetypes)

4. **Customers per round:** 3 per player (2 players = 6, 3 players = 9, 4 players = 12)

---

## Round Structure

Each round follows these phases in order:

### 1. Planning Phase

All players click "Ready" when finished investing.

### 3. Customer Draft Phase
Customers are dealt one at a time in a **pass-or-take** draft:

1. **Drawer** reveals a customer card (shows archetype on front)
2. **Drawer decides:** Take the customer or pass
3. **If passed:** Next player decides (take or pass)
4. **Full circle:** If everyone passes, customer returns to drawer who must take it
5. **Repeat** until all customers for the round are distributed

**Important:** You only see the customer's archetype (front) when deciding. The specific order requirements (back) are hidden until resolution!

### 4. Customer Resolution Phase
Now the orders are revealed! For each customer you took:

1. **Review the order** - See what supplies are required
2. **Decide to fulfill or skip** - Toggle which customers to serve
3. **All players confirm** their choices simultaneously

**Fulfilling an Order:**
- Pay the required supplies
- Receive the money reward
- Customer outcome determined (delighted, satisfied, or stormed out)

**Skipping an Order:**
- Customer storms out (reputation penalty)
- Storm out effects may apply (archetype-specific penalties)

### 5. Shop Closed Phase
- Review the results of customer service
- See who was delighted, satisfied, or stormed out
- All players click "Ready" to proceed

### 6. Cleanup Phase
**Pay Rent:** Every player must pay $10 rent

- **Can afford:** Money is deducted automatically
- **Can't afford:** Go bankrupt and are eliminated!
- **Bailout option:** Other players can pay your rent for you

After rent, a new round begins (first drawer rotates).

## Strategy Tips

### Early Game
1. **Buy supplies conservatively** - You don't know what orders you'll get
2. **Draft safe customers** - Average Joes are reliable income
3. **Save money for rent** - Always keep $10+ buffer

### Mid Game
1. **Watch the reputation track** - High reputation means more customers
2. **Invest in coffee machine** - Free resources compound over time
3. **Know your archetypes** - Learn which customers match your supplies

### Late Game
1. **Calculate carefully** - Count your supplies vs. potential orders
2. **Skip strategically** - Sometimes it's better to let a customer storm out
3. **Consider bailouts** - Keeping opponents in the game can benefit you (more customers to draft)

### General Tips
- **Diverse supplies** help with Influencer delight conditions
- **Surplus supplies** trigger many delight bonuses
- **Reading opponents** - Watch what supplies others buy to predict their draft behavior
- **The draft is key** - Good drafting wins games more than anything else
