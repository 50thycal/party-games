## Building Rockets

Rockets are your primary weapon against the comet. Each rocket has three attributes:

### Rocket Attributes

| Attribute | Range | Effect |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **Power** | 1-6 | Damage dealt to comet on a successful hit |
| **Accuracy** | 1-6 | Hit on dice roll ≤ this value (higher = more reliable) |
| **Build Time** | 1-3 | How quickly the rocket is ready |

### Build Time Cost System

| Build Time | Cube Cost | Turns to Build |
|------------|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | 1 cube | 2 turns |
| 2 | 2 cubes | 1 turn |
| 3 | 3 cubes | Instant (ready immediately) |

### Total Rocket Cost
**Total Cost = Power + Accuracy + Build Time**

*Example: A rocket with Power 4, Accuracy 3, and Build Time 2 costs 4+3+2 = 9 cubes*

### Building Limits
- You can only **build ONE rocket per turn**
- Maximum of **3 rockets in progress** at any time (can be upgraded)
- Power and Accuracy are capped at **3** initially (can be upgraded to 6)

---

## Launching Rockets

When you launch a ready rocket:

### The Dice Roll
1. Roll a **single 6-sided die (1d6)**
2. Compare the result to your rocket's **Accuracy**:
   - **HIT:** Roll ≤ Accuracy
   - **MISS:** Roll > Accuracy

*Example: Accuracy 4 means you hit on rolls of 1, 2, 3, or 4 (66% chance)*

### On a Hit
- Deal **[Power] damage** to the active comet segment
- If damage **≥ segment's remaining health**:
  - **Destroy** the segment
  - **Collect it as a trophy** (worth its strength value in points)
  - Next segment becomes active
- If damage **< segment's health**:
  - Reduce segment health by your power
  - Segment remains active

### On a Miss
- Your rocket is consumed with no effect
- **If you have a Reroll Token:** You may choose to use it for a second chance
- **If you are Sabotaged:** You must reroll (no choice - see Sabotage below)

---

## The Comet

### Comet Distance
- The comet starts at **distance 18** from Earth
- Each round, a **Movement card (1-3)** is drawn
- The comet moves that many spaces closer to Earth
- **If the comet reaches distance 0: EARTH IS DESTROYED!**

### Comet Segments (Strength Cards)
- The comet has multiple segments, each with a **strength value (4-9)**
- Players must destroy segments in order (first to last)
- Each segment has health equal to its strength value
- When a segment is destroyed, the player who dealt the final blow **claims it as a trophy**

## Special Mechanics

### Reroll Protocol (Your Choice)
When you obtain a "Reroll Protocol" card:
- You gain a **reroll token**
- If your rocket launch **misses**, you may choose to use the token
- Roll the die again - this could turn a miss into a hit!
- The token is **consumed** whether you hit or miss on the reroll
- Each token is **single-use**

### Sabotage (Forced Reroll)
When an opponent plays "Sabotage" on you:
- Your **next rocket launch** is affected
- If you **HIT** on your first roll: You **must** reroll (could become a miss!)
- If you **MISS** on your first roll: The rocket is spent (no second chance)
- Sabotage creates risk - even a perfect roll might become a miss!

### Embargo (Income Block)
When targeted by "Embargo":
- On your **next turn**, you receive **0 income**
- Your base income and bonuses are skipped for that turn only
- The embargo clears after it takes effect

### Comet Research (Intel Gathering)
When you play "Comet Research":
- Choose to peek at either the **top Movement card** or **top Strength card**
- This information is **private** - only you can see it
- Helps you plan: Will the comet move 1 or 3 spaces? How strong is the next segment?

## Winning & Losing

**Final Destroyer Bonus:** The player who destroys the **final segment** receives **+5 bonus points!**

### Defeat: Earth Destroyed!

## Strategy Tips for New Players

### Early Game
1. **Build income first** - "Increase Income" cards pay off over many turns
2. **Start with balanced rockets** - Power 2, Accuracy 3 is reliable and cheap
3. **Don't rush expensive rockets** - You need cubes for future turns

### Mid Game
1. **Upgrade your caps** - Higher Power and Accuracy unlock stronger rockets
2. **Watch the comet distance** - Don't let it get too close!
3. **Use Political cards strategically** - Embargo right before a big turn hurts most

### Late Game
1. **Go for the final segment** - The +5 bonus can win the game
2. **High-power rockets matter** - Overkill damage still counts for trophies
3. **Save Reroll tokens** - Use them when it really counts

### General Tips
- **Accuracy 4+** gives you better than 50% hit chance
- **Salvage bonus** makes even misses less painful
- **Comet Research** before big decisions helps you plan
- **Don't hoard cards** - Playing them is usually better than saving
